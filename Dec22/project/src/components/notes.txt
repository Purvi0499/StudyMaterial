Promise:
- Promise object contains both the producing code and 
  calls to the consuming code
- three states of a promise are :
  1. Pending - result here is undefined
  2. Fulfilled - result here is a value
  3. Rejected - result here is an error object
- promise method must be used to handle promises.
- Promise.then() takes two arguments, 
    a callback for success and another for failure.
- Promise can either be rejected or resolved based on the operation outcome.
- Promise chaining is helpful when we have multiple interdependent asynchronous functions, 
  and each of these functions should run one after another.
