Promise:
- Promise object contains both the producing code and 
  calls to the consuming code
- three states of a promise are :
  1. Pending - result here is undefined
  2. Fulfilled - result here is a value
  3. Rejected - result here is an error object
- promise method must be used to handle promises.
- Promise.then() takes two arguments, 
    a callback for success and another for failure.
- Promise can either be rejected or resolved based on the operation outcome.
- Promise chaining is helpful when we have multiple interdependent asynchronous functions, 
  and each of these functions should run one after another.


Validations:
- Validation is the process of checking whether the information provided
  by the front-end user is correct or not as per the requirements
- Basic Validations:  It is a process to make sure that all of the mandatory fields are filled or not.
- Data Format validation: it is the process to check that entered data is correct or not.


Boolean:
- The ES6 Boolean objects can represent two values, either 'true' or 'false'. 
- In JavaScript, the Boolean is used as a function 
  to get the value of an object, a variable, conditions, expressions, 
  and many more in terms of true and false.
properties
  1. Constructor : returns a constructor function for an object.
  2. Prototype   : to add properties and methods to the Boolean instances.
methods
  1. toSource 
  2. toString
  3. valueOf


Modules 
- Modules are the piece or chunk of a JavaScript code written in a file.
- JavaScript modules help us to modularize the code simply by partitioning 
  the entire code into modules that can be imported from anywhere.
